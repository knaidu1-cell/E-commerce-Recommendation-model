This is an academic project of a Personalized E-commerce Recommendation System. The data analysis pipeline involved the below steps:

Data Exploration
Data Pre-processing
Feature Engineering
Machine learning models testing,finetuning and evaluationâ€“
User and Model-based Collaborative Filtering
SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and SVD ++
Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
KNN Clustering
Libraries used: Pandas, Scikit-learn, PySpark, Seaborn, Surprise


The Dataset is from a public dataset from OList, a Brazilian Ecommerce store:
