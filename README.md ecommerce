Ecommerce Recommender System with Spark ALS
This project builds an end-to-end recommender system for an e-commerce platform using Apache Spark’s ALS (Alternating Least Squares) algorithm on transaction and review data. The workflow covers data ingestion, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation inside a single notebook.

Project overview
Use real-world e-commerce orders, products, customers, and reviews data.

Engineer customer–product interaction features (recency, frequency, monetary value, product/category info, review scores).

Build explicit/implicit feedback matrices and train an ALS recommender.

Evaluate recommendation quality with ranking metrics such as precision at K.

Generate top-N product recommendations for each customer segment.

Features
Data preprocessing:

Load and join multiple raw tables (orders, items, customers, sellers, reviews).

Handle missing values, outliers, and skewed distributions with log transforms.

Encode categorical variables and index IDs for ALS input.

Exploratory data analysis:

Descriptive stats of order values, prices, freight, review scores, and product attributes.

Category-level aggregates (number of products, orders, and average price).

RFM/behavioral features such as recency, distinct products purchased, and purchase frequency.

Modeling:

Build a user–item rating matrix from customer–product interactions.

Train Spark ALS with hyperparameters (rank, regularization, iterations).

Evaluate recommendations using held-out interactions and ranking metrics (e.g., precision).

Recommendations:

Generate top-K product recommendations per customer.

Inspect example users, recommended items, and scores.

Tech stack
Python

Apache Spark (SparkSession and MLlib ALS)

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas / NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
