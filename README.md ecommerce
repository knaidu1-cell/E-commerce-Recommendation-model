E-commerce Recommendation System using Python

This is an academic project of a Personalized E-commerce Recommendation System. The data analysis pipeline involved the below steps:

1. Data Exploration
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Machine learning models testing,finetuning and evaluation–
5. User and Model-based Collaborative Filtering
6. SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and SVD ++
7. Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
8. KNN Clustering
Libraries used: Pandas, Scikit-learn, PySpark, Seaborn, Surprise

The Dataset is from a public dataset from OList, a Brazilian Ecommerce store:
